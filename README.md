# booksite

A personal place to log books I have read.

## How to use

The user (me) can enter and log new books. Information includes

- title
- author
- status (to read, reading, read, DNF)
- rating (1-5 out of 5)
- review

## Technologies

- html/css
- jQuery
- flexbox

- node.js
- express
- mySQL

## Features to implement

- login/user verification - I want the book information to be available to the public, but updates/adding new information only available to me
- different views - ideally I would like the book page to be set up so you can see only unread books, or only finished books, or etc
- author search - only include books by certain authors, etc
- library API - include a CPL search

## TDL

- login functionality/login specifics
- nav

done:

- create/format cards
- book submit
- book update
- some data verification so you can apply books to an existing author?

## Future plans:

- switch to react
- switch to django/flask
